# Covid19_Analyses

This will be a collection of R scripts that can read in and plot the official Covid-19 numbers from the RKI (https://github.com/robert-koch-institut). The aim is also to uncover correlations between vaccinations and infections / hospitalisations / deaths (work in progress). 

The repository belongs to my course "Data Analysis with R" https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/sosem22/public-humanities-tools-1/ at https://github.com/DH-Cologne.
